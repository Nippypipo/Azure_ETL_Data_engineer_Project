Hello, today I'm going show my ETL pipeline project that I learned during my Data Engineer internship at BBIK.

Overview
This project overview involves creating an ETL pipeline from extracting data from the data source to delivering quality data for presentation in a PowerBI dashboard, primarily using Microsoft Azure: Cloud Computing Services.

For the ETL process in this project, it includes extracting data from the data source (SQL Server), followed by data transformation at the staging area (Data Lake), before loading it into the Lakehouse (Delta Lake)

You can find the code here, along with an article that discusses the details of this project, at this link <link>.
